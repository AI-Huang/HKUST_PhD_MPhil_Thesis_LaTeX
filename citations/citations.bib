  abstract = {This study addresses two objectives: (1) to develop a formal method of optimally locating a dense network of air pollution monitoring stations; and (2) to derive an exposure assessment model based on these monitoring data and related land use, population, and biophysical information. Previous studies have located monitors in an ad hoc fashion, favouring the placement of monitors in traffic “hot spots” or in areas deemed subjectively to be of interest. We apply our methodology in locating 100 nitrogen dioxide monitors in Toronto, Canada. Locations identified by the method represent land use, transportation infrastructure and the distribution of at-risk populations. Our exposure assessments derived from the monitoring program produce reasonable estimates at the intra-urban scale. The method for optimally locating monitors may have widespread applicability for the design of pollution monitoring networks, particularly for measuring traffic pollutants with fine-scale spatial variability.}

  abstract = {Hazardous chemicals escape to the environment by a number of natural and/or anthropogenic activities and may cause adverse effects on human health and the environment. Increased combustion of fossil fuels in the last century is responsible for the progressive change in the atmospheric composition. Air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties, emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease, or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have also been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy. These effects of air pollutants on human health and their mechanism of action are brieﬂy discussed.},
