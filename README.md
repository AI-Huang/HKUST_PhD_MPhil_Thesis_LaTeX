# HKUST_PhD_MPhil_Thesis_LaTeX

LaTeX template for PhD/MPhil. thesis based on my own MPhil. thesis.

This template can also be used in **PhD thesis** as long as **changing all "MPhil" to "PhD"**.

This is a HKUST PhD/MPhil thesis latex template based on the latest official samples:

- https://pg.ust.hk/guides_n_forms/students/thesis_sample_page_mphil.pdf
- https://pg.ust.hk/guides_n_forms/students/thesis_sample_page_phd.pdf

The origin author\[1\] of this latex template said:

> I know there is some latex templates for HKUST PhD/MPhil. But they are too old and not easy to modify. I create this one based on the latest official sample which is totally different than the older one. This one is written as easy as I can. Almost every page can be modified as you want. Suitable for beginners.

Please report issues if there is any questions and requirements.

## TODOs

- 1.I don't know what the file "ustthesis_Department2ProgramOffice.cls" is used for.
- 2.The output format is NOT yet totally consistent with HKUST library, with regard to page size, etc.
